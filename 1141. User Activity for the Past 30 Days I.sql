-- Table: Activity

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | user_id       | int     |
-- | session_id    | int     |

-- A user is considered active if they had **any** activity on a given day.
-- Return the result with columns: `day` (date), `active_users` (int)

-- ‚úÖ SQL Solution:
SELECT
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM
    Activity
WHERE
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY
    activity_date
ORDER BY
    activity_date;
